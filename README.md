# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

This is a machine learning-based crop recommendation system that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and weather conditions. The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset and helps improve decision-making for farmers by predicting the best crop for given inputs.

##  Features
- Predicts the best crop to grow using ML classification
- Based on inputs like:
  - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK)
  - Temperature, Humidity
  - pH and Rainfall
- Built with real agricultural data from Kaggle
  
## Tech Stack
Python, Flask
HTML/CSS (Jinja2 templating)
Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning model (.pkl)
